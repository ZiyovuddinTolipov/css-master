                        <span class="bot-dot">DOMs</span>, broken <span class="bot-dot">CSS</span> support, and
                        abandoned browsers.

                        We must clear the mind of the past. Web enlightenment has been achieved thanks to the tireless
                        efforts of folk like the <span class="bot-dot">W3C</span>, <span class="bot-dot">WaSP</span>,
                        and the major browser creators.

                        So What is This About?
                    </h3>
                    <p>
                        There is a continuing need to show the power of <span class="bot-dot">CSS</span>. The Zen Garden
                        aims to excite, inspire, and
                        encourage participation. To begin, view some of the existing designs in the list. Clicking on
                        any one will load the style sheet into this very page. The <span class="bot-dot">HTML</span>
                        remains the same, the only thing
                        that has changed is the external <span class="bot-dot">CSS</span> file. Yes, really.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span class="bot-dot">CSS</span> allows complete and total control over the style of a hypertext
                        document. The only way this
                        can be illustrated in a way that gets people excited is by demonstrating what it can truly be,
                        once the reins are placed in the hands of those able to create beauty from structure. Designers
                        and coders alike have contributed to the beauty of the web; we can always push it further.

                        Strong visual design has always been our focus. You are modifying this page, so strong
                        <span class="bot-dot">CSS</span>skills are necessary too, but the example files are commented
                        well enough that even <span class="bot-dot">CSS</span> novices can use them as starting points.
                        Please see the CSS Resource Guide for advanced tutorials and
                        tips on working with <span class="bot-dot">CSS</span>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        You may modify the style sheet in any way you wish, but not the <span
                            class="bot-dot">HTML</span> . This may seem daunting at
                        first if you’ve never worked this way before, but follow the listed links to learn more, and use
                        the sample files as a guide.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Download the sample HTML and CSS to work on a copy locally. Once you have completed your
                        masterpiece (and please, don’t submit half-finished work) upload your <span
                            class="bot-dot">CSS</span>
                        file to a web server under your control. Send us a link to an archive of that file and all
                        associated
                        assets, and if we choose to use it we will download it and place it on our server.

                        Why participate? For recognition, inspiration, and a resource we can all refer to showing people
                        how amazing <span class="bot-dot">CSS</span> really can be. This site serves as equal parts
                        inspiration for those working on
                        the web today, learning tool for those who will be tomorrow, and gallery of future techniques we
                        can all look forward to.

                    <h3>Requirements</h3>
                    <p>
                        Where possible, we would like to see mostly <span class="bot-dot">CSS 1 & 2</span> usage.
                        <span class="bot-dot">CSS 3 & 4</span>should be limited to
                        widely-supported elements only, or strong fallbacks should be provided. The CSS Zen Garden is
                        about functional, practical <span class="bot-dot">CSS</span> and not the latest bleeding-edge
                        tricks viewable by 2% of the browsing public. The only real requirement we have is that your
                        <span class="bot-dot">CSS</span> validates.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Luckily, designing this way shows how well various browsers have implemented CSS by now. When
                        sticking to the guidelines you should see fairly consistent results across most modern browsers.
                        Due to the sheer number of user agents on the web these days — especially when you factor in
                        mobile — pixel-perfect layouts may not be possible across every platform. That’s okay, but do
                        test in as many as you can. Your design should work in at least IE9+ and the latest Chrome,
                        Firefox, iOS and Android browsers (run by over 90% of the population).
